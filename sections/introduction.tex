\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction} % Don't use bold this way in the actual report - only for template purpose.
%\textbf{Motivation} — Why this topic is important nowadays.\\
This paper is about the Minimax algorithm and Alpha/Beta pruning, which make up the core of our former assignment 
"Tic-Tac-Toe using Minimax" for the subject Data Science. We chose to cover this project over other projects because 
the topics were among the more interesting and we wanted to research these further.
\\
%\textbf{Project objectives} — what is the expected result.
One of the objective of this paper would be to shed some light on the Minimax Algorithm, 
how it works, why this is interesting along with an implentation of it.
The main objective is showing how to optimize this algorithm further by implementing Alpha/Beta pruning and comparing 
it to the bare Minimax Algorithm.
\\
%\textbf{Scope of the project} — what is not an objective or a task.\\
We will do this by describing the logic behind the topics and showing implementations from the Tic-Tac-Toe assignment,
that we will be modifying for the purpose of this paper.
This paper is not meant to prove anything new, but is simply a result of a fascination with Alpha Beta Pruning.
%\textbf{Brief description of the other chapters that follow} — one paragraph per each.
The report is split in sections explaining about Minimax alone and its implementation and then with Alpha Beta Pruning 
also following up with its implementation.
