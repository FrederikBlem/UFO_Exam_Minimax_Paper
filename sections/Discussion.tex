\subsection{Compare results}
This subsection will be used to show the results of the pruning.\\
In the notebook without pruning (V3) on turn 1 the AI considered 549945 different moves.
In the notebook with pruning (V4) on turn 1 the AI considered 30709 different moves.\\
This means that on turn one V4 managed to prune away around 93\% of the moves that would be considered without pruning.\\
On turn 3 this went from 7331 down to 1519 which is again a significant decrease of around 80\%.
These prunings of course become smaller in number as the game had fewer possible moves, and at turn 7 it would no longer prune anything.\\
These findings can be seen better by running files \href{code/TicTacToe_MinimaxV3.ipynb}{MinimaxV3.ipynb} 
and \href{code/TicTacToe_MinimaxV4.ipynb}{MinimaxV4.ipynb} in the code folder of this project.

%\subsection{Reflection}
\subsection{Conclusion}
%Brief summary:What  has  been  done  and  the  benefits  of  it. Recommendation for future extensions and upgrades. Reflection on the work and the product.
The Jupyter Notebook TicTacToe\textunderscore MinimaxV4.ipynb is the resulting implementation of 
Alpha Beta Pruning that was compared with the original notebook.
Version 4 has significantly fewer considered moves, presumably resulting in a slightly faster game 
for this implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe.
If implemented on a game like chess, which requires the algorithm to check many more moves per depth, 
pruning would likely save a considerable amount of time compared to the bare minimax function.\\
Future implementations, that would be interesting to include, could be: input validation, Multiplayer (humans), AI versus AI games, allowing for picking X or O, 
a choice of board size and potentially different games. Of those it would be relevant to test Alpha Beta Pruning on future versions 
with allowing for picking X or O and on different board sizes.\\
% Reflection: what went well, what could be better
For a small project like this, simply comparing the amount of considered moves between notebook versions has worked well.
On the other hand, more precise tools could have been used to compare and to test efficiency and impact of Alpha Beta Pruning.
