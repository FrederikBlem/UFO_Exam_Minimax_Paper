\subsection{Compare results}
This subsection will be used to show the results of the pruning.

In the notebook without pruning (V3) on turn 1 the AI considered 549945 different moves.
In the notebook with pruning (V4) on turn 1 the AI considered 30709 different moves.

This means that on turn one we managed to prune away around 93\% of the moves it would consider without pruning.

On turn 3 this went from 7331 down to 1519 which is again a significant decrease of around 80\%
These prunings of course become less and less as the game has less possible moves, and at turn 7 it would no longer prune anything. 

These findings can be seen better by running files \href{code/TicTacToe_MinimaxV3.ipynb}{MinimaxV3.ipynb} and \href{code/TicTacToe_MinimaxV4.ipynb}{MinimaxV4.ipynb} in the code folder of this project.
