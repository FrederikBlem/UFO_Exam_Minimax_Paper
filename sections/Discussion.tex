\subsection{Compare results}
This subsection will be used to show the results of the pruning.\\
In the notebook without pruning (V3) on turn 1 the AI considered 549945 different moves.
In the notebook with pruning (V4) on turn 1 the AI considered 30709 different moves.\\
This means that on turn one we managed to prune away around 93\% of the moves it would consider without pruning.\\
On turn 3 this went from 7331 down to 1519 which is again a significant decrease of around 80\%
These prunings of course become less and less as the game has less possible moves, and at turn 7 it would no longer prune anything.\\
These findings can be seen better by running files \href{code/TicTacToe_MinimaxV3.ipynb}{MinimaxV3.ipynb} 
and \href{code/TicTacToe_MinimaxV4.ipynb}{MinimaxV4.ipynb} in the code folder of this project.

%\subsection{Reflection}
\subsection{Conclusion}
%Brief summary:What  has  been  done  and  the  benefits  of  it. Recommendation for future extensions and upgrades. Reflection on the work and the product.
The Jupyter Notebook TicTacToe\textunderscore MinimaxV4.ipynb is the result of our implementation of 
Alpha Beta Pruning that we compared with the original notebook.
Version 4 has significantly fewer considered moves, presumably resulting in a slightly faster game 
for our implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe.
If implemented on a game like chess, which requires the algorithm to check many more moves per depth, 
pruning would likely save an unbelievable amount of time compared to the bare minimax function.\\
Future implementations, that would be interesting to test Alpha Beta Pruning on, could include: input validation, Multiplayer (humans), AI versus AI games, allowing for picking X or O, 
a choice of board size and potentially different games.\\
% Reflection: what went well, what could be better
For a small project like this, simply comparing the amount of considered moves between notebook versions has worked well.
On the other hand, we could have compared using more precise tools to test efficiency and impact of Alpha Beta Pruning.
